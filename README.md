# FreeFilmProject-Scripts
A repository for scripts (for actors, graphics editors, renderers, audio tools, lighting controls, etc)

The Free Film Project is an experiment in producing the software and sample scripts needed to produce a high-quality independent film.

Be aware that no software or script can replace good actors, costumes, props and hardware.

Also be aware that good writing tools are no substitute for a good writer.

The tools merely give the team the opportunity to do exactly the same job as they'd do for a few thousand more using commercial tools.

On small productions, that can make or break the whole effort.

Even on larger productions, every penny not wasted is a penny that can be spent on adding value.

The Free Film Project is a revival of the original project, which played a small but important part in bringing independent movie making to the masses.
